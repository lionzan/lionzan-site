Offers considered by serious buyers for quick sale  
This boat requires work to bring it up to a good order hence why it is priced about 14K less than comparable boats  
The options are i will pull the boat off the market and spend about 10k then market it for £29,000 or you can buy it for the reduced price and decide on what upgraded equipment you want to have installed  
Recent survey has been done no major defects found the surveyors comments to me was it is a bit tired but that is reflected in the price
